## 🎯 Core Java Focus

This repository emphasizes **Java-specific problem solving**, including:

- ✔ Java Collections Framework  
  (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `Deque`, `PriorityQueue`)
- ✔ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ✔ Time & Space Complexity Optimization
- ✔ Clean code structure and naming conventions
- ✔ Practical Java usage in DSA scenarios

Streams API and advanced optimizations are used where they improve clarity or performance.
